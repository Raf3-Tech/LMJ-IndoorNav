# LMJ-IndoorNav

A mobile application enabling visually impaired individuals to navigate independently within LMJ Hospital. Utilizes computer vision for obstacle detection, real-time audio guidance, and voice commands to identify landmarks and provide contextual navigation instructions throughout hospital departments and facilities.

## Overview

The LMJ-IndoorNav application addresses significant challenges faced by visually impaired individuals when navigating the complex indoor environment of LMJ Hospital in Blantyre. The hospital's layout with multiple wings, specialized departments, and busy corridors creates difficulties for those with visual impairments.

Traditional navigation aids like canes or guide dogs provide basic obstacle avoidance but cannot offer specific directional guidance or contextual information about hospital facilities. This application serves as a comprehensive navigation solution that promotes independence and dignity when accessing healthcare services.

## Project Aim

To provide a smartphone-based, real-time navigation solution specifically designed for visually impaired patients and visitors navigating LMJ Hospital's complex indoor environment. Using computer vision and voice interaction, it enables independent, hands-free navigation through obstacle detection, customized audio guidance for LMJ Hospital-specific locations, and voice control.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Obstacle Detection**: Identifies and alerts users to obstacles in their path using computer vision technology
- **Audio-Based Navigation Guidance**: Delivers clear, real-time audio instructions to guide users through indoor spaces
- **Voice-Activated Control**: Allows hands-free operation through voice commands like "Guide me to Radiology" or "Where is the nearest accessible restroom?"
- **Landmark Identification**: Recognizes and announces key indoor features to provide contextual awareness
- **User-Friendly Auditory Interface**: Offers intuitive interaction with customizable settings and responsive feedback

## Technical Implementation

The application is being developed using an Object-Oriented Methodology (OOM), emphasizing:
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Independent components that can be reused across features
- **Scalability**: Design that allows for future enhancements without restructuring the core system
- **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: Complex processes hidden behind simple interfaces

### Technologies Used

- Android/iOS development frameworks
- Computer vision technology (OpenCV)
- Natural language processing for voice commands
- Local data processing for user privacy
- Audio guidance system
